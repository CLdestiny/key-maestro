Quick start guide
1. Prepare your Mac
   - Ensure you are on a supported macOS version.
   - Confirm that you have admin privileges for installation and that you can adjust security settings as needed.
   - Make sure you have a clear set of goals for what you want to automate. Start with small tasks to understand how triggers and actions flow.

2. Install Key Maestro
   - Download the installer from the releases page.
   - Open the installer and walk through the setup wizard.
   - Grant necessary permissions in System Settings when prompted.
   - Open the macro editor to begin creating your first macro.

3. Create a simple macro
   - Pick a trigger. For example, a hotkey combination like Command-Shift-A.
   - Define an action sequence. Start with a simple action such as launching a specific app or typing a snippet.
   - Save the macro and test it in a safe context to confirm it behaves as expected.
   - Iterate as needed, adding conditions or timing controls to refine the behavior.

4. Organize your workspace
   - Create macro groups to categorize tasks (for example, “Audio Workflows,” “Coding Helpers,” and “Daily Routines”).
   - Add descriptive names and notes to each macro so you can find and adjust them later.
   - Use logical naming patterns to keep large libraries manageable.

5. Expand gradually
   - Once your first macro works, build a small set of related macros to handle a complete workflow.
   - Use templates to copy and adapt macros for new projects.
   - Document your macros so teammates can reuse and improve them.

6. Back up your macros
   - Store your macro files in a version control-friendly format. This makes it easier to track changes and share improvements with others.
   - Regularly back up your library to a secure location.

Building your macro library
A strong macro library starts with a plan. The library should reflect how you work, not how you wish you worked. Start with a few core tasks that you perform every day and expand outward from there. Here is a practical approach:

- Baseline tasks: Create macros for common actions you perform every day. Examples include launching your DAW, starting your project template, or composing a standard email.
- Common workflows: Build macros that connect multiple apps into a single flow. For example, a project handoff from a DAW to a review tool, or a coding session that sets up your editor, terminal, and browser.
- Editing and production: Create macros to apply frequently used editing commands, export formats, or batch-processing steps in audio or video software.
- Personal automations: Automate routine tasks such as setting up your workspace, organizing files, or managing windows.

Macro design principles
- Clarity first: Give each macro a clear, descriptive name. Avoid cryptic abbreviations.
- Single responsibility: Each macro should perform one cohesive task or a small, well-defined flow.
- Predictable timing: If a macro interacts with external apps, consider delays or readiness checks to ensure the target app is ready to receive input.
- Idempotence: Make macros safe to run multiple times if needed. If appropriate, guard actions so repeated runs do not cause unintended consequences.
- Reusability: Build modular actions that can be composed for larger tasks.
- Documentation: Include notes in the macro about its purpose, triggers, and any dependencies.

Macro design examples
- Example 1: Quick project setup
  - Trigger: Global hotkey ⌘⌥P
  - Actions: Open project folder, launch DAW, open project template, set a default tempo, load a starting layout.
  - Why it helps: Reduces setup time before a session and guarantees a consistent starting point.

- Example 2: Pro Tools session navigator
  - Trigger: Keystroke in Pro Tools
  - Actions: Bring Pro Tools to the foreground, navigate to a specific track, arm recording, and apply a standard monitoring setup.
  - Why it helps: Speeds up session navigation and reduces repetitive keystrokes.

- Example 3: Quick note capture
  - Trigger: Typing a keyword at the start of a sentence in any app
  - Actions: Create a new note in a notes app, insert a timestamp, and append the text.
  - Why it helps: Makes capturing ideas effortless during work sessions.

Deep dive: triggers, actions, and flow
Triggers
- Hotkeys: Global or per-app hotkeys to start a macro.
- Typed phrases: Short sequences typed to start a macro or insert a block of text.
- App state: Macros that run when a specific application is active or a window is focused.
- Timers: Delayed triggers or periodic checks for changes in system state.
- System events: Events like sleep/wake, volume changes, or screen lock.

Actions
- Input simulation: Keystrokes, mouse clicks, and drag-and-drop actions.
- Window management: Move, resize, focus windows, or arrange layouts.
- App control: Launch, quit, or bring apps to the front; send commands to apps via their scripting interfaces.
- File and clipboard: Read, write, or transfer data to and from the clipboard; save files or create new ones.
- Scripting hooks: Run AppleScript, JavaScript for Automation (JXA), or shell commands to extend capabilities.
- Pro Tools commands: Launch Pro Tools, switch tools or tracks, apply standard editing actions, or export mixes.

Flow design
- Sequence: A clear step-by-step set of actions that achieves a goal.
- Branching: Use conditions to handle different states or inputs. Branches keep the macro robust.
- Error handling: Include fallback steps when a target app is not ready or an action fails.
- Timing: Use delays or await app readiness to synchronize with other apps.
- Logging: Keep a simple log of macro runs to help troubleshoot or optimize.

Example macro workflows for common tasks
- Workflow: Quick export from a DAW
  - Trigger: Hotkey
  - Steps: Stop playback, bounce mix, move to export folder, rename file with timestamp, close mixer window.
  - Outcome: A single keystroke exports and organizes the final file.

- Workflow: Research note capture
  - Trigger: Typing a keyword
  - Steps: Create a new note, append the current date and time, paste link, save to a specific folder.
  - Outcome: Your notes stay organized with consistent metadata.

- Workflow: Code debugging session setup
  - Trigger: Command-Option-N
  - Steps: Open editor, set workspace layout, open terminal, run a test script, enable logging.
  - Outcome: A ready-to-work development environment.

Example workflows with Pro Tools
- Pro Tools project navigation
  - Trigger: Global hotkey
  - Actions: Focus Pro Tools; select a track; show the mixer; arm a track.
  - Benefit: Faster session management without leaving the keyboard.

- Pro Tools session template
  - Trigger: Macro group activation
  - Actions: Load a preconfigured template, import standard audio tracks, apply a default routing setup, install a monitoring preset.
  - Benefit: Uniform project structure across sessions.

- Pro Tools export automation
  - Trigger: Keystroke
  - Actions: Stop, bounce to disk, move the file to a designated folder, log the export, restore previous session state.
  - Benefit: Efficient handoffs in a production cycle.

Advanced usage
- Scripting integration
  - AppleScript and JavaScript for Automation let you query app state, fetch data, or drive more complex interactions.
  - Example patterns: Read a document's metadata, extract a value from a file, or trigger app-specific commands.
- Shell commands
  - Use shell scripts for tasks like file processing, batch operations, or invoking external tools.
  - Ensure you handle input/output carefully and validate results before proceeding in a macro.
- Conditional logic
  - Branch on conditions such as whether a window is visible, a file exists, or an app is running.
  - Conditional steps help you create resilient automations.

Performance tips
- Start small: Build a few reliable macros first, then add complexity.
- Optimize triggers: Prefer robust triggers that won’t fire unintentionally.
- Minimize delays: Use the shortest delays necessary to keep actions in sync with the target apps.
- Use grouping: Organize macros into groups to avoid conflicts and reduce search time in the editor.
- Test in isolation: Verify each macro on its own before combining them into larger workflows.

Troubleshooting
- Permission checks: Ensure accessibility permissions are granted and the app appears in the allowed list.
- App readiness: Some actions depend on an app responding to commands. Add readiness checks or small delays between steps.
- Conflicts: If two macros trigger at the same time, decide priority or create explicit conditions to avoid clashes.
- Debugging: Run diagnostics to confirm triggers are firing and actions are executing as expected. Log key steps and outcomes.

Security and privacy
- Data handling: Be careful when macros access sensitive data, such as passwords or personal files.
- Scripting permissions: When using AppleScript or shell commands, review scripts for safety and avoid executing untrusted code.
- Access controls: Limit macro access to groups and specific users to minimize unintended changes.
