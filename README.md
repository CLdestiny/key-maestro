## 🤖 What is Keyboard Maestro for Mac?

**Keyboard Maestro** is an advanced macOS automation tool designed to help users streamline workflows, save time, and enhance productivity. Whether you're a power user, a developer, a writer, or just someone who wants to automate repetitive tasks, Keyboard Maestro allows you to create **custom macros** that perform actions with the press of a key or based on triggers like login, USB connections, or application events.

At its core, Keyboard Maestro provides a powerful editor where you can build **multi-step actions** using a drag-and-drop interface. These actions can include:

- Launching or quitting apps  
- Typing text or simulating keystrokes  
- Controlling windows or the clipboard  
- Moving and clicking the mouse  
- Interacting with menus, files, or system preferences  
- Running scripts in AppleScript, Shell, or JavaScript  
- Creating custom automation chains for apps like **Pro Tools**, **Final Cut**, **Xcode**, and more

One of Keyboard Maestro's key strengths is its flexibility: it supports complex conditional logic, variables, loops, and user input prompts, allowing you to build sophisticated workflows without needing traditional programming.

It also integrates seamlessly with **macOS Monterey, Ventura, and Sonoma**, and it runs natively on both **Intel and Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3)** Macs.

Whether you're automating video editing workflows, simplifying software testing, managing clipboard history, or automating your daily writing routine, **Keyboard Maestro** is your personal digital assistant — customizable, precise, and always available at a keystroke.
